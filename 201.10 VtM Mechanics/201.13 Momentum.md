# Momentum
- I love this idea, but how does it work with WP or a reroll system?
- Creates four resources to manage:
  - Momentum
  - Action Economy
  - Blood (This is only for VtM)
  - Focus
  - Health Tracks (Not really a resource, I guess?)

Momentum is supposed to provide a resource that can be used either to cement a victory (by pushing advantages) or to provide something similar to the “edge” actions in Shadowrun, but available to everyone. 

GM’s should have an “momentum” pool for goons, and then probably track it for important individuals if desired.
