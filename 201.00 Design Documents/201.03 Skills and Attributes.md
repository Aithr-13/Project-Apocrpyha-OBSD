# META
## What does this section need?
- Fleshing out of specializations and cacades
- Theorycrafting on the movement rules to make sure they don’t create sound-barrier shattering centaurs.
- Recoil management derived attribute balancing

### Cascade
- [ ] Description of this genre of skills #pa_tbd 
- Cascade skills are skills which are often “nice to have” but often do not justify the cost compared to other skills, like Knowledge skills in Shadowrun. 
- Ideally there’s a way to reward investment at milestones. 
- Example: at 3 dots, you may pick a second “cascade” to pick up. When you rank up your primary skill, you get to put a free dot in that cascade. If you choose, you can spend points on that second cascade, (from 1 → 2, or 2→3) and get another skill point to drop. 
### General Skills

## Active Combat Skills
### Personal Weapons (Melee)
#### Examples:
Knives, batons, brass knuckles
### Martial (Melee)

One-handed swords, small two-handed swords, hatchets, baseball bats
### Great Weapons (Melee)
#### Examples:
Halberds, pikes, greatswords, long spears
### Uncommon Weapons (Non-Firearm)

Whips, ‘stingers’, and other unconvential melee weapons
### Personal Weapons (Ranged)

### Martial Firearms (Ranged)

### Hand to Hand
#### Examples:
Your fists, homie.
### Sorcery 🌊
#### Examples:
Combat spellcasing or other similar skills.
#### Special:
This is a cascade, meaning there are a number of setting-dependent branches of this skill. A character *must* specialize in a branch when selecting the skill.

## Specializations
> [!INFO]- DEV NOTE - Complication Dice
>- [ ] Need a system for specializations for non-cascade skills #pa_tbd 
> - Lots of options here. Gating “martial techniques” (think fallout perks, new advanced actions, or “advantages” when hitting certain skill ranks) 
> - Could also provide an option similar to cascades, where you can choose to forgo specializations to become a “generalist” and get more points in different items in the same category

# Attributes
## Might
#### Power
A measure of a person’s physical strength, power, and explosive fitness. Strength influences things like lifting heavy objects, jumping long distances, melee damage, and so on.
#### Fitness
Endurance, ability to absorb damage, ability to do things over a long period of time.
## Grace
#### Coordination
#### Dexterity
## Nature
#### Empathy
#### Manipulation
## Mind
#### Cognition
#### Acuity
## Will
#### Volition
#### Resolve

# Derived Attributes
### RECOIL MANAGEMENT - FIT + CRD + SKILL FEATS?
> [!INFO]- DEV NOTE - RECOIL MANAGEMENT
> - [ ] Need to determine how recoil compworks #pa_tbd 
> - Ideally, you have a passive recoil reduction stat. A weapon firing in a certain firemode at a certain speed is going to cause X amount of recoil, so there isn’t a ton of math needed.
> - Recoil adds complication dice to the pool. See
### FOCUS (Willpower replacement) - Highest Mind + Highest Will
Must spend to use the “push the limit” action, which can cause stress damage/accumulating penalties if abused.

> [!INFO]- DEV NOTE - Focus’ other uses 
> Focus also can be spent to break out of certain mind control abilities, and so on. Damage is generally not done directly to Focus (as willpower damage in games like VTM is bullshit)
### MOVEMENT (per tick)
MOV = FIT + CRD + POW / 3 (Rounding Up)
Walking = 1/tick
March/Tactical = MOV grids
Running = MOV x 2
Sprinting = MOV x 2 + (Athlethics test, net successes / 2 = meters added)

2/2/2 average human has:
March/Tactical of 2m/tick
Run of 4m/tick
Sprint of 4m + 1-2.

### AVOIDANCE RATING 
> [!INFO]- DEV NOTE - Avoidance Rating
> - [ ] Avoidance rating needs definitions #pa_tbd 
> - Design intent is to create a way that “dodges” can work without creating loads of rolls
> - Sets a base difficulty threshold for hitting a target

ACUITY + COORDINATION / 3 = Avoidance Rating.

### INITIATIVE
#### OODA:
**Observe, Orient, Decide, Act**: an abstract measure of a character’s cognitive ability to perceive rapidly changing information in a stressful situation, and act on it. 

It is initially calculated by taking a character’s Volition + Acuity, and adding 5. Characters may increase the guiding attributes to increase this score, or purchase Qualities (positive or negative) which influence this. 

#### Action Potential:
**Action Potential**: A score which indicates how much quickly a character can move, and how much they can accomplish in a given turn. Action potential starts for all characters at CRD + FIT + 2d10, and may be modified in the future with abilities or qualities in some settings.

For normal humans, it is unusual to have an action potential higher dice pool higher than 2d10.

#### Putting it together:
At the start of a combat, initiative is calculated by rolling the Action Potential dice-pool, and then adding the result to OODA. The character with the highest value goes first, subtracting the cost of their actions as they go. 

When that character has taken at least their OODA value worth of actions, the next highest value character gets to take actions. If the character who acted first is still the highest, they continue taking actions until someone else has a higher Initiative than they do.

Tldr; like Shadow-run, but without fixed 10-initiative pass turns, and characters can ‘steal’
