### Cascade
- [ ] Description of this genre of skills #pa_tbd 
- Cascade skills are skills which are often “nice to have” but often do not justify the cost compared to other skills, like Knowledge skills in Shadowrun. 
- Ideally there’s a way to reward investment at milestones. 
- Example: at 3 dots, you may pick a second “cascade” to pick up. When you rank up your primary skill, you get to put a free dot in that cascade. If you choose, you can spend points on that second cascade, (from 1 → 2, or 2→3) and get another skill point to drop.

# Specializations
> [!INFO]- DEV NOTE - Complication Dice
>- [ ] Need a system for specializations for non-cascade skills #pa_tbd 
> - Lots of options here. Gating “martial techniques” (think fallout perks, new advanced actions, or “advantages” when hitting certain skill ranks) 
> - Could also provide an option similar to cascades, where you can choose to forgo specializations to become a “generalist” and get more points in different items in the same category
