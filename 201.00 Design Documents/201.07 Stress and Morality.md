# Stress, Morality, and The Spaces Between

## META - What does this section need?
- A “Humanity” score, which is threatened by high-stress events
- A “save” or “resistance roll” for stress. (See [[201.05 Damage and Resistances]] for inspiration) Maybe use the higher of the 2 attributes from the group + FOCUS?
	- IE, Isolation 7 damage incoming getting yeeted through a spooky mirror. You roll the highest attribute in the group, plus Focus.
- Add a "base” level for “stress tracks”
	- If a character only has 2 points in the Might attribute group, technically they only have 2 “violence” health. 
	- We probably want to add a +5 as a base, or something similar? 

## What is Stress?
Stress is a dark part of our everyday lives, but matters even more for the sort of heroic villains and heroes seen in the games run in Project Apocrypha. 

Stress represents exposure to horrific ideas, sights, moments of helplessness, self-doubt, or things beyond a character’s comprehension. It temporarily causes damage to an attribute group, and can over time wear away at the very things that make us who we are.
